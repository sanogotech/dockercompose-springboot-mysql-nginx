- "A Java class can only extend one parent class. Multiple inheritance is not allowed.
 Interfaces are not classes, however, and an interface can extend more than one parent interface. 
The extends keyword is used once, and the parent interfaces are declared in a comma-separated list".

- "HATEOAS is an acronym for Hypermedia As The Engine Of Application State. Even after expanding that for you, it still might not mean a lot. 
HATEOAS is an extra level upon REST and is used to present information about a REST API to a client, allowing for a better understanding of the API without the need to bring up the specification or documentation. This is done by including links in a returned response and using only these links to further communicate with the server."
